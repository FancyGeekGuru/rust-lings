# rustlings

Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. Includes practice reading and responding to
compiler messages!

This repo is very much the smallest thing that could possibly work :)

## To do these exercises

* Go to a raw .rs file
* Copy-paste into [the Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org)
* Follow the instructions in the comments

## To help with this repo/TODO list

* File issues for problems or suggestions!
* Contribute more exercises! Anything that took you time to get used to, or that you had trouble with, or that deserves practice would be a good exercise!
* Organize the exercises (by topic? progression of difficulty?)
* Add some exercises that are "make the test pass" instead of "make this compile"
* Write some hints or sample answers
* Figure out a nice way to link the code directly into playpen
