// The us_presidential_frontrunners module is trying to present an external
// interface (the `democrat` and `republican` constants) that is different than
// its internal structure (the `democrats` and `republicans` modules and
// associated constants). It's almost there except for one keyword missing for
// each constant.
// One more hint: I wish the compiler error, instead of saying "unresolved name
// `us_presidential_frontrunners::democrat`", could say  "constant
// `us_presidential_frontrunners::democrat` is private"!
